<h3 id="development-build-profiles"><a class="header" href="#development-build-profiles">Development Build Profiles</a></h3>
<p>By default, Jumpy will build without optimizations for the <code>jumpy_core</code> and <code>jumpy</code> crates. This helps reduce re-compile times at the expense of some runtime performance. If you need increased runtime performance during development, you can build with the <code>--profile dev-optimized</code> option, to optimize all of the crates:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cargo r --profile dev-optimized

<p><img src="community/./contributing_art/art_section_header.png" alt="art_section_header" /></p>
<p>This guide will show you the steps to draw art using the Fish Fight style. Following these steps will help your custom art fit better in the Fish Fight world. For this example, we will focus on creating a cannon weapon, but these principles can be applied to other assets as well. If you are completely new to pixel art, make sure to take a look at the <a href="community/contributing_art.html#additional-resources">Additional Resources</a> section first.</p>
<h2 id="concept"><a class="header" href="#concept">Concept</a></h2>
<p>Before you start drawing, you need to have a clear idea of what it is you are creating. We recommend finding a few reference images that you can look at while creating your art. Even the best artists do this. Drawing something completely from memory tends to not give the best results. Below are some reference images we found for cannons.</p>
<p><img src="community/./contributing_art/cannon_references.PNG" alt="cannon_references" /></p>
<h2 id="outline"><a class="header" href="#outline">Outline</a></h2>
<p>Now that you have some references, you can start drawing your art! To start off, draw an outline of the object's prominent features. Keep outlining more details until it is recognizable as the object you are creating. Below is the outline for the cannon weapon:</p>
<p><img src="community/./contributing_art/cannon_outlines.png" alt="cannon_outlines" /></p>
<p>Here are the guidelines we use for outlining:</p>
<ul>
<li>All details for the object should be completely surrounded by outlines</li>
<li>All outlines should be 1 pixel thick</li>
<li>Outlines should use a dark color</li>
<li>Generally, all outlines should be the same color</li>
<li>Only non-solid materials like smoke, fire, etc. should be drawn without outlines</li>
<li>If the object has holes, make them the same color as the outline</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="color"><a class="header" href="#color">Color</a></h2>
<p>After you've finished outlining your object you are ready to begin coloring. Below is the cannon weapon after being colored:</p>
<p><img src="community/./contributing_art/cannon_colors.png" alt="cannon_colors" /></p>
<p>Here are the guidelines we use for applying color:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use colors that have a similar saturation level with game's existing assets</li>
<li>Use contrasting colors to distinguish different parts of the object</li>
<li>The entire object should be filled with color (no transparency)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="shadows-and-details"><a class="header" href="#shadows-and-details">Shadows and Details</a></h2>
<p>After coloring, shadows and details can be added to the object, but try to keep it clean and recognizable. Below is the cannon after adding shadows and details.</p>
<p><img src="community/./contributing_art/cannon_details.png" alt="cannon_details" /></p>
<p>Here are the guidelines we use for adding shadows and details:</p>
<ul>
<li>For contrasting shadows, use one light and one dark color</li>
<li>Use hue shifting to create color ramps</li>
<li>Avoid anti-aliasing</li>
</ul>

<p>Have an account on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>: this is where you'll find the <a href="https://github.com/fishfolk/jumpy">source code</a> for Fish Fight.</p>
<h3 id="getting-the-source-code"><a class="header" href="#getting-the-source-code">Getting the source code</a></h3>
<p>Fish Fight uses <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> as its established choice of version control. You'll be
using it to clone, track, and manage the source code locally on your machine.</p>
<p>To get a copy of the code, you'll first need to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo">fork the repository</a>.
The GitHub repository for Fight Fight is <a href="https://github.com/fishfolk/jumpy">available here</a>.
This will allow you to make changes to the project without affecting the original one.</p>
<p>Once you've forked the Fish Fight repository, you can now clone it:</p>
<p><code>git clone https://github.com/fishfolk/jumpy.git</code></p>
<p>It's also possible to clone the repo using SSH or GitHub CLI. For more information on how to do
this, see the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#cloning-your-forked-repository">official GitHub documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Depending on your connection, the clone can take around 1 minute.</p>
<p>By the end of this step, you should have successfully forked and downloaded a clone of Fish Fight on your machine.</p>
<h3 id="build-and-run"><a class="header" href="#build-and-run">Build and run</a></h3>
<p>You can now build your forked copy of Fish Fight:</p>
<p><code>cargo build</code></p>
<p>This process should take about a minute or two depending on your machine. You can also <strong>build and run</strong> the game with a single command:</p>
<p><code>cargo run</code></p>
<h2 id="2-finding-a-good-first-issue"><a class="header" href="#2-finding-a-good-first-issue">2. Finding a good first issue</a></h2>

<h2 id="3-write-code-and-submitting-for-review"><a class="header" href="#3-write-code-and-submitting-for-review">3. Write code and submitting for review</a></h2>
<p>In general, Fish Fight uses a branch-based workflow (or <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow">GitHub flow</a>) for submitting changes to the project.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-new-branch"><a class="header" href="#create-a-new-branch">Create a new branch</a></h3>
<p>You'll want to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow#create-a-branch">create a new branch</a> off <code>main</code>:</p>
<p><code>git checkout -b &lt;branch_name&gt; main</code></p>
<p>You'll replace <code>&lt;branch-name&gt;</code> with something short and descriptive. For example, if you're adding a new
item to Fish Fight, your branch name might look like this:</p>
<p><code>git checkout -b add_new_weapon main</code></p>
<h3 id="commit-your-changes"><a class="header" href="#commit-your-changes">Commit your changes</a></h3>
<p>Once you've made the desired changes to the code and you're ready for someone on the Fish Fight
team to review, you need to <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit">commit your work</a>. But first,
we have to run a few commands to ensure the code you're submitting is properly formatted:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>cargo clippy -- -W clippy::correctness -D warnings</code></li>
<li><code>cargo fmt</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Now we can start committing your work. First, stage your changes:
<code>git add</code></p>
<p>Now commit. It's always good practice to provide a short message that details what the changes are. For example:
<code>git commit -m &quot;Add a new weapon&quot;</code></p>
<h3 id="submitting-for-review"><a class="header" href="#submitting-for-review">Submitting for review</a></h3>
<p>You can now start submitting your work for review. First, push your changes:</p>
<p><code>git push</code></p>
<p>This will create a new branch on your forked copy of Fish Fight. You can then proceed <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/working-with-your-remote-repository-on-github-or-github-enterprise/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request#creating-a-pull-request">making a pull request</a>.
This is how the Fish Fight team will review and provide feedback on your work.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="juice-and-feel"><a class="header" href="#juice-and-feel">Juice and Feel</a></h1>
<p><strong>Juice</strong>, or <strong>game feel</strong>, is the science and art of making pushing a button viscerally satisfying. Well, more precisely it's about giving feedback to confirm the player's actions. For games where flow and feeling matter, juice is the thing that makes the player understand your game without reading dials and processing numbers. Juice gives a game life and soul that makes the player feel like a part of the world. Juice is what makes a game feel fun without actually making any mechanical difference. And juice might just be what makes or breaks your game.</p>
<p>Whenever you do something in real life you get a wide range of sensory input in return indicating that what you tried to do actually happened. That response grounds you and makes you realise the reality and weight of things. As you might guess, replicating that kind of feedback on a flatscreen is hard. To get anywhere near reality you need hyperreal effects and nerve-blasting feedback to fill in for all the missing senses, all the while walking the fine line of overloading your player and making a dry, unresponsive world.</p>
<p>Of course, not all games need equal amounts of juice. Some games are played mostly in your head, and therefore all that visual feedback is not needed. Civilization has little more than flavour animations when a unit attacks, a town is built or a nuke blows up (actually the last one is pretty nice, but the real juice is your enemy’s tears). These are rather abstract both mechanically and visually, rarely pertaining to situations and perspectives we encounter in our everyday life. These games would still work with nothing but coloured circles and lines, because the strategy and the story exists in the player’s head. These games are <em>planning</em> games, where the payoff is to after thousands of years of careful strategising triumph over your enemy.</p>
<p>On the other side of the spectrum are <em>execution</em> games that test your reflexes and motor skills. These are played visually with the game continually telling the player what is going on. Here, the payoff is landing that single-frame-margin combo and watching your enemy explode into a glorious cloud of gibs. The juice that in a planning game exists in the player’s head must here be given by the game.</p>
<p>For realistic first-person games, juicing is difficult and labour-intensive in practice but easier in concept, as you can model the feedback off reality to align with the player’s expectations. But a side-scrolling shooter like Fish Fight is more difficult in theory. I’d doubt you have a clear picture of how stylised two-dimensional fish running and shooting each other would look in real life. For something so far detached from reality, you must work a lot in the same way as with symbol drawing: finding effects that represent their real-life counterparts without actually being them. You'll have to unhinge your expectations and think out of the box to find the feel you need.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-game-feel"><a class="header" href="#working-with-game-feel">Working with game feel</a></h2>
<p>The worst part about working with game feel is that it is only ever noticed if it is bad. Good game feel is only felt, never seen. If the juice is so grandiose that the player starts thinking of it, it will wear them out and possibly even make them sick if too much stuff is moving onscreen. But if there is not enough of it, the game will feel dry and lifeless. The juice is there to constantly trigger and must therefore be <em>just</em> right. On that matter, juicing games is more artsy compared to, for instance, UI design. There are certain guidelines to follow, but mostly it's lots of tuning and testing. The easiest way to try the feel is simply to play the game! If even mundane actions like walking feels nice, you have really succeeded.</p>
<p>Juicing also regards making the world feel alive by making it respond, cause and effect, to the player's actions. Whipping up dust while running or jostling foliage when walking through it are common effects that give the impression of a breathing coherent world in which all its separate parts coexist and interact. This doesn't do anything mechanically, but is equivalent to hitting a wooden crate and it not breaking. Now you maybe even shudder a bit at the thought of how lifeless, bland and plain wrong it would feel. Well, the player too has expectations on how the world should respond. Your task is to meet and feed into those expectations on all levels, from the core greyboxed mechanics to minute tweens and particle effects.
Now, for some ways to actually squeeze some juice out of your games!</p>
<h2 id="screen-shake"><a class="header" href="#screen-shake">Screen Shake</a></h2>
<p>Screen shake is an immensely powerful tool for giving heavy, visceral feedback that disorients the player as if their whole body was actually rumbling. When the entire scene shakes the player <em>feels</em> it, usually without thinking of it. Regular flatscreen games are only connected to two of the players senses, vision and hearing, and that is all you have to work with. The ears can be shaken about with some explosion noises, but to equally rustle the player’s eyes you need screen shake.</p>
<p>Screen shake moves the player’s viewpoint around, translationally and/or rotationally, to make it appear the world is rumbling. Adding the right amount of shake is an art; it is crucial to not overdo screen shake as it can hamper readability and even make sensitive players motion sick, but at the same time it must be significant enough to be felt. People usually have very split opinions on screen shake. Some love the punch it gives, others detest the blurry jostling. Try to take a step back and don't get too caught up in the looks, the game must still be playable.</p>
<h3 id="screen-shake-in-practice-in-fish-fight"><a class="header" href="#screen-shake-in-practice-in-fish-fight">Screen shake in practice in Fish Fight</a></h3>
<p>Screen shake is a lot about feel, and as such requires a lot of dialling in. In jumpy we will have three kinds of screen shake: noise (Perlin) translational, sinusoidal translational and rotational. Translational noise moves the world up- and sideways, while the rotational noise rotates the world around the screen midpoint. To that, you can also make the screen shake only in a certain axis to give it directionality. Omnidirectional shaking is the most common and can be used for pretty much everything. It fits explosions really well, but won't feel out of place for anything else either. The directional type on the other hand is more specialised and can for example be used vertically for jump impacts or horizontally for guns firing sideways. This further enhances feedback and narrows its meaning down, increasing clarity and readability.</p>
<p>To those types there’s three parameters: magnitude, frequency and length. Magnitude affects how far the screen moves when shaking (the amplitude of the oscillation) while frequency controls how ”many” shakes happen per second. The length decides for how long the shake will last for, and the magnitude decreases over this time to zero.</p>
<p>By mixing and matching different values for these parameters different effects can be made. Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gunshot: a short omnidirectional shake with low amplitude and high frequency. This gives a small kick that doesn’t move the screen too much, just enough to confirm the firing.
Fish Fight supports setting multipliers for X/Y movement, so a 1 for X and a smaller number for Y makes the player feel the direction of the action.</li>
<li>Explosion: a medium-length omnidirectional shake with decent amplitude and lower frequency. This makes a kind of rumble that seriously jostles the screen. The bigger the explosive the lower the frequency!</li>
<li>Jump impact: a directional sinusoidal shake makes the world bounce like a spring.</li>
</ul>
<p>To calculate the final scene position, the current position of every active shake is added together. That value is then capped using a logarithmic function so that if many explosives go off at once, the scene does not fly off-screen. The second logarithm (log<sub>2</sub>x) is useful for this, as it is almost linear from 0-1 and then quickly flattens.</p>
<h2 id="particles"><a class="header" href="#particles">Particles</a></h2>
<p>Particles like those in games rarely occur in real life, as most of us go through our daily routine avoiding high-impact situations. But games tend to be a bit more forceful and violent, and that of course means heaps of particles! Particles are a great way to create dynamic and exciting effects that further give impact and weight to actions, but also make the world seem more alive and responsive. Some examples are sparks flying when a bullet hits a wall or dust blowing around in a storm.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="legacy-documentation"><a class="header" href="#legacy-documentation">Legacy Documentation</a></h1>
<p>After the Bevy rewrite, the Jumpy book was revised, but not all of the old pages have been migrated
to the new revision.</p>
<p>The legacy documentation can still be read <a href="https://fishfolk.github.io/jumpy-legacy-docs/">here</a>,
and while much of it is now out of date, some of the pages still have useful thoughts, and may be
good to migrate to this book.</p>
